# 02-diamond

## Problem Statement
Write a program that takes a number as input and prints a diamond of that height.

* You can assume the input will be an _odd_ number between 1 and 99
* You can print any character that will combine to visually form a diamond shape (e.g. `*` here)
* Your output must be only the diamond of correct size and any necessary whitespace

## Test cases

```
input = 1

*

input = 5

  *
 ***
*****
 ***
  *

input = 11

     *
    ***
   *****
  *******
 *********
***********
 *********
  *******
   *****
    ***
     *
```

## Sample run

```sh
$ ruby test.rb 5
  *
 ***
*****
 ***
  *
```
