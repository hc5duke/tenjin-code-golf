# 02-diamond

## Problem Statement
Write a program that takes a number as input and prints a diamond of that height.

* You can assume the input will be an _odd_ number between 1 and 99
* You can print any character that will combine to visually form a diamond shape (e.g. `*` here)
* Your output must be only the diamond of correct size and any necessary whitespace
